        <p>Hello everyone my name is Carl Goss. I am a student currently enrolled at Eleven Fifty acadamy. Enough about me, take a look at this picture.
              Isn't it beautiful.  What is art?  “Anybody can look at a pretty girl and see a pretty girl. An artist can look at a pretty girl and see the old woman she will become. 
              A better artist can look at an old woman and see the pretty girl that she used to be. But a great artist-a master-and that is what Auguste Rodin was-can look at an old woman, 
              protray her exactly as she is...and force the viewer to see the pretty girl she used to be...and more than that, he can make anyone with the sensitivity of an armadillo, 
              or even you, see that this lovely young girl is still alive, not old and ugly at all, but simply prisoned inside her ruined body. He can make you feel the quiet, 
              endless tragedy that there was never a girl born who ever grew older than eighteen in her heart...no matter what the merciless hours have done to her. Look at her, Ben. 
              Growing old doesn't matter to you and me; we were never meant to be admired-but it does to them.”
              ― Robert Heinlein  </p>

                        <p class="aboutText">I graduated from Ball State University in 2019 with a major in Computer Science, a minor in
                            History, and having completed the Honors College curriculum and Thesis. During my time at BSU, I immersed myself
                            into the logic and analytical problem-solving field that is coding, learning new languages and fundamentals for a
                            wide array of abilities and conceptual understandings. I was intrigued by the field because I grew up wanting to
                            make videogames and once I started learning, I was blown away with the possibilities of programs and how they are
                            built.</p>

                        <p class="aboutText">After graduating, I worked a part time job at home while reviewing my school projects and learning
                            whenever possible. I knew something was missing in my education, as I was troubled by the lack of professional
                            experience to gain from college. A friend of mine introduced me to Eleven Fifty Academy after I told her about my
                            interest in growing more as a developer and pushing the bounds of my knowledge. As a current student of Eleven
                            Fifty's .NET Software Development course, I am learning at an accelerated pace and I enjoy every unit of knowledge
                            pumped into my brain from this <a href="https://youtu.be/yBLdQ1a4-JI?t=12" title="Eleven Fifty Academy">wonderful course.</a></p>
