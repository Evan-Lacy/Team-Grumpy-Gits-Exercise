                        <p class="aboutText">I graduated from Ball State University in 2019 with a major in Computer Science, a minor in
                            History, and having completed the Honors College curriculum and Thesis. During my time at BSU, I immersed myself
                            into the logic and analytical problem-solving field that is coding, learning new languages and fundamentals for a
                            wide array of abilities and conceptual understandings. I was intrigued by the field because I grew up wanting to
                            make videogames and once I started learning, I was blown away with the possibilities of programs and how they are
                            built.</p>

                        <p class="aboutText">After graduating, I worked a part time job at home while reviewing my school projects and learning
                            whenever possible. I knew something was missing in my education, as I was troubled by the lack of professional
                            experience to gain from college. A friend of mine introduced me to Eleven Fifty Academy after I told her about my
                            interest in growing more as a developer and pushing the bounds of my knowledge. As a current student of Eleven
                            Fifty's .NET Software Development course, I am learning at an accelerated pace and I enjoy every unit of knowledge
                            pumped into my brain from this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBLdQ1a4-JI" title="Eleven Fifty Academy">wonderful course.</a></p>
